1. Core Synthesizer Features
These are the essential building blocks for generating and shaping sound.

Oscillators
Waveforms:
Basic: Sine, square, sawtooth, triangle.
Advanced: Pulse with PWM (pulse width modulation), noise (white, pink, brown).
Controls:
Waveform selection.
Frequency (pitch adjustment).
Amplitude (volume control).
Detune (for richer, thicker sounds).
Phase offset (to alter the starting point of the waveform).
Advanced Features:
Multiple oscillators with individual settings.
Oscillator syncing (locking phase between oscillators).
Unison mode (stacking detuned voices for a broader sound).
Filters
Types:
Low-pass (attenuates high frequencies).
High-pass (attenuates low frequencies).
Band-pass (isolates a frequency band).
Notch (removes a specific frequency band).
Controls:
Cutoff frequency (sets the filter’s boundary).
Resonance (Q factor, emphasizing frequencies near the cutoff).
Filter type selection.
Envelopes
Types:
ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) for:
Amplitude (volume shaping over time).
Filter cutoff (dynamic frequency shaping).
Pitch (evolving pitch changes).
Advanced: Multi-segment envelopes for more intricate modulation curves.
Modulation
Types:
FM (Frequency Modulation): Modulating the frequency of one oscillator with another.
AM (Amplitude Modulation): Modulating the amplitude of one oscillator with another.
RM (Ring Modulation): Multiplying two waveforms for metallic, bell-like tones.
Controls:
Modulation depth (intensity of the effect).
Modulation frequency (speed or pitch of the modulator, for FM and AM).
Carrier and modulator waveform selection.
LFOs (Low-Frequency Oscillators):
Waveform selection (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle).
Frequency (speed of modulation).
Depth (amount of modulation).
Target parameters (e.g., pitch, filter cutoff, volume).
2. Effects (FX)
Effects add depth and character to the sound, with adjustable parameters for creative control.

Essential Effects
Reverb: Simulates acoustic space.
Parameters: Decay time, room size, damping.
Delay: Repeats the sound over time.
Parameters: Time (delay interval), feedback (repeat intensity), wet/dry mix (balance).
Chorus: Thickens the sound with subtle detuning.
Parameters: Rate (speed), depth (intensity), feedback.
Distortion: Adds grit or warmth.
Parameters: Drive (amount), tone (color), level (output volume).
Additional Effects
Flanger: Creates a sweeping, comb-filter effect.
Parameters: Rate, depth, feedback.
Phaser: Produces a swirling, phase-shifted sound.
Parameters: Rate, depth, feedback.
EQ: Shapes the frequency spectrum.
Parameters: Frequency bands, gain, Q (bandwidth).
Compressor: Controls dynamics.
Parameters: Threshold, ratio, attack, release.
3. Wavetable Creation and Manipulation
A standout feature for a deep synthesizer, allowing users to craft custom waveforms.

Core Features:
Draw custom waveforms manually.
Import waveforms from audio files.
Edit existing wavetables (adjust shape, amplitude, etc.).
Save and load wavetables for reuse.
Manipulation Tools:
Interpolation between waveforms (smooth transitions).
Morphing between wavetables (gradual evolution).
Apply effects to wavetables (e.g., filtering, distortion).
Advanced:
Wavetable scanning (moving through the wavetable dynamically).
Granular synthesis (breaking waveforms into tiny grains for textured sounds).
4. User Interface (UI) and Real-Time Feedback
An intuitive UI with real-time feedback enhances usability and creativity.

UI Layout
Sections:
Oscillator section (waveform and control adjustments).
Filter section (type and parameter tweaks).
Effects section (effect chain and settings).
Modulation section (LFOs, envelopes, matrix).
Global controls (master volume, polyphony settings).
Controls: Knobs, sliders, and dropdowns for precise adjustments.
Real-Time Feedback
Visual Tools:
Oscilloscope (displays the waveform in real time).
Spectrum analyzer (shows frequency content).
Envelope visualizers (graphs ADSR curves).
Modulation matrix (maps modulation sources to targets).
Responsiveness: Parameters update the sound instantly with minimal latency.
5. Additional Features for Versatility
These features make the synthesizer more playable and interactive.

Performance Features
Polyphony: Play multiple notes simultaneously.
Portamento: Smooth glide between notes.
Arpeggiator: Automatically cycles through held notes in patterns.
Sequencer: Records and loops note sequences.
Input Support: MIDI, on-screen keyboard, touch/gestural controls (for mobile).
User Experience Enhancements
Preset Management: Save, load, and share presets locally.
Randomization: Generate random parameter settings for inspiration.
Undo/Redo: Revert or reapply changes easily.
Tooltips: Provide explanations for controls.
Shortcuts: Keyboard commands for quick actions.
6. Performance and Optimization
Ensuring the synthesizer runs efficiently, even with complex setups.

Strategies:
Use efficient algorithms for oscillators and filters.
Implement voice stealing (reusing voices when polyphony limits are reached).
Offer options to cap voices or effects for lighter CPU load.
Leverage Web Audio API nodes for built-in performance benefits.
7. Accessibility and Educational Tools
Making the synthesizer inclusive and a learning resource.

Accessibility
Keyboard navigation and ARIA labels for screen readers.
High-contrast themes and adjustable control sizes.
Educational Features
Tutorials or guided tours of the interface.
Explanations of synthesis concepts (e.g., what FM does).
Interactive demos for each feature.
